# Detecting-Covid-19-In-X-Ray-Image
 COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The disease first originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and soon became a global pandemic, spreading to more than 213 countries.
 
 Common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that people may experience include aches, pains, or difficulty in breathing. Most of these symptoms show signs of respiratory infections which can be detected by radiologists.Thus, it is possible to use Deep Learning algorithms to detect the disease from images of Chest X-rays and CT scans. Automated applications can be created to help support radiologists.
 So,this project aims to detect Covid19 cases from the xray images. 
 
 Where I get the dataset
 Covid-19 dataset is publicly available in kaggle website.
